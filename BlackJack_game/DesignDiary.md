I didn't anticipate this much frustration, but I still feel like I'm struggling with the 
basics in being able to navigate through the Unity platform in general. 
I'm having issues with my camera. When I test my game, my cards will flip on the scene
portion of the screen, but not the game portion. I'm beating myself up pretty
badly because I spent too much time on a lab that had low point value. I'm not feeling confident. 
I don't feel like I have overloaded my schedule, but I have fears of failing my
other classes because I'm putting so much time into this class, and I have absolutley 
nothing to show for it. I don't really know what I'm doing, and I'm really doubting myself.

I've hit a road block while trying to get my cards to random shuffle. I'm not sure if there is something wrong
with my card prefab or if I have some how incorrectly associated it with my script because it does not populate
in my game the same way it does in the tutorials. I've been following a tutorial knowing that I will have to account 
and adjust the user input factor and the scaleable deck size that is dependent on the user input. I find that I have become
more familiar with the terms and how the different objects work, how to build classes for them, and some of the aspects I never considered
like physics such as the gravity aspect. I've been watching a series of tutorial videos, so I can become better acclimated with C# and with the 
Unity platform in general. I have been following a series, and this particular one has the issue that I'm unable to resolve.

I have ran into some road blocks, but first I want to focus on the successs I've had today while working on my project. This class consumes far
more time than any of my other classes, so I find it important to highlight positives. I was able to get my cards to display, and also increment
my player's count of cards every time I hit the "hit me" button. While I wish I could think of this code on my own, I'm still at a level where I need
a lot of assistance. I'm excited that I was able to start the removal of cards scipt. This will help with the visual appeal as well as keeping track of 
cards that have already been in play in the game. It was also nice to see some of the code that I had followed along in the tutorial actually work!
I figured that a tutorial would be easy since I would be sitting and listening to someone show me how 
their thought process works aloud, and that is definatley not the case--atleast for me any way. I was able to flip
my deck of cards facedown by inserting a boolean, and only applying it to the player instead
of the dealer too.

I'm seriously so pissed off right now. Everytime I do a diary entry and then I save it somehow it is not in there. I have lost 2 days of notes, and 
tracking off issues, and I'm over it for now. I can't keep spending several hours to loose work and not get credit. I'm not stupid when it comes
to savings. I'm so lost in this class, in this assignment, and quite frankly in my life. I have no idea why I'm even in school trying to learn this
because I keep making mistakes that take days of work and completey erase them. I AM DONE WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT! I have cried enough
