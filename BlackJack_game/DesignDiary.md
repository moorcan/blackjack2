I didn't anticipate this much frustration, but I still feel like I'm struggling with the 
basics in being able to navigate through the Unity platform in general. 
I'm having issues with my camera. When I test my game, my cards will flip on the scene
portion of the screen, but not the game portion. I'm beating myself up pretty
badly because I spent too much time on a lab that had low point value. I'm not feeling confident. 
I don't feel like I have overloaded my schedule, but I have fears of failing my
other classes because I'm putting so much time into this class, and I have absolutley 
nothing to show for it. I don't really know what I'm doing, and I'm really doubting myself.'
