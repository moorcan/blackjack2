I didn't anticipate this much frustration, but I still feel like I'm struggling with the 
basics in being able to navigate through the Unity platform in general. 
I'm having issues with my camera. When I test my game, my cards will flip on the scene
portion of the screen, but not the game portion. I'm beating myself up pretty
badly because I spent too much time on a lab that had low point value. I'm not feeling confident. 
I don't feel like I have overloaded my schedule, but I have fears of failing my
other classes because I'm putting so much time into this class, and I have absolutley 
nothing to show for it. I don't really know what I'm doing, and I'm really doubting myself.

I've hit a road block while trying to get my cards to random shuffle. I'm not sure if there is something wrong
with my card prefab or if I have some how incorrectly associated it with my script because it does not populate
in my game the same way it does in the tutorials. I've been following a tutorial knowing that I will have to account 
and adjust the user input factor and the scaleable deck size that is dependent on the user input. I find that I have become
more familiar with the terms and how the different objects work, how to build classes for them, and some of the aspects I never considered
like physics such as the gravity aspect. I've been watching a series of tutorial videos, so I can become better acclimated with C# and with the 
Unity platform in general. I have been following a series, and this particular one has the issue that I'm unable to resolve.
